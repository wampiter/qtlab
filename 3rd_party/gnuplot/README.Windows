This is gnuplot version 4.4.4 -- binary distribution for MS-Windows 32bit
=========================================================================


News: the default terminal is set to 'wxt' terminal instead of the traditional
'windows' terminal. The default terminal can be controlled by setting the
'GNUTERM' environmental variable or by putting 'set term windows|wxt' into
gnuplot.ini.


Binaries included:
------------------

* wgnuplot.exe: The default gnuplot executable.

* wgnuplot_pipes.exe: Like above, with the advantage of support for unixish
  features like
	plot `<awk -f change.awk data.dat`
  and the disadvantage of having attached a console window.

* gnuplot.exe: Text (console) mode version of the gnuplot executable with all
  the associated pipe functionality as it is usual on all other platforms.
  This means that this program can also accept commands on stdin (standard
  input) and print messages on stdout (standard output). This program replaces
  pgnuplot.exe and it is recommended to use it for 3rd party applications
  using gnuplot as graph engine, for example Octave (www.octave.org).

* pgnuplot.exe: This program will accept commands on stdin (standard input),
  and pipe them to an active (or newly created) wgnuplot.exe text window.
  Command line options are passed on to wgnuplot.
  Effectively, this means `pgnuplot' is an almost complete substitute for
  `wgnuplot', on the command line, with the added benefit that it does accept
  commands from redirected stdin. (Being a Windows GUI application, `wgnuplot'
  itself cannot read stdin at all.)

* runtime library files
  Runtime library files (e.g. freetype6.dll) that are required for gnuplot 
  excution are included.  For the license of these runtime libraries, see the 
  documents in the license directory.


Installation
------------

* Unzip this package in an appropriate directory, e.g.
  C:\Gnuplot, C:\Apps\gnuplot, C:\Program Files\gnuplot etc.
  If you want to install gnuplot in C:\Program Files you need do be logged
  on as an administrator.

* If you want a shortcut icon, go to the directory where wgnuplot.exe is 
  installed.  Right-click on the program (wgnuplot.exe, gnuplot.exe, or 
  wgnuplot_pipes.exe) you want to create the shortcut for.
  You may also want to assign filename extensions like *.gp, *.gpl, *.plt to
  be executed by gnuplot.  To set file associations in Windows 7 or Vista, go
  to "Control Panel", "Control Panel Home", "Default Programs",
  "Set Associations". Select a file type in the list and click
  'Change Program'.

* You can find loads of test and sample scripts in the 'demo' directory. Try
  executing `test` and `load "all.dem"`.

* On startup, gnuplot executes the gnuplot.ini script from the the user's
  application data directory %APPDATA% if found, see `help startup`. The
  wgnuplot and the windows terminal load and save settings from/to wgnuplot.ini
  located in the appdata directory, see `help wgnuplot.ini`.

  
Help on Windows Vista and 7
---------------------------

* Windows Vista and Windows 7 no longer support the help system used by
  gnuplot 4.4 out of the box. You will need to install WinHlp32.exe to be able
  to access help.
  You can find the Vista version at
    http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5143 .
  The version for Windows 7 you can find at
    http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=91 .
  You may need to to log on as administrator once and remove the 
  "access forbidden" flag on the help file by right-click the icon of
  wgnuplot.hlp.


Environmental variables
-----------------------

For the complete list, type 'help environment' in gnuplot.

To set environment variables go to "Control panel", "System", ("Advanced"),
"Environmental variables" on Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista, or Right click on
the Computer icon on your Desktop and choose Properties option, "System",
"Advanced system settings", "Advanced", "Environmental variables" on Windows 7.

* Add gnuplot binary directory to PATH, e.g. in AUTOEXEC.BAT:
	SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Apps\gnuplot\bin
  It has the advantage for you or any 3rd party program to call gnuplot.exe, 
  wgnuplot.exe, wgnuplot_pipes.exe and pgnuplot.exe directly from the 
  command line.

* Variable HOME is examined as a directory where a gnuplot.ini startup file
  might be found. See "help start-up". If HOME is not set, then USERPROFILE
  is used instead (this is usually set on newer MSW for logged-in user).

* Variable GNUPLOT_LIB may be used to define additional search directories for
  data and command files. The variable may contain a single directory name, or
  a list of directories separated by a platform-specific path separator, i.e.
  ':' on Unix, or ';' on DOS/Windows/OS/2/Amiga platforms. The contents of
  GNUPLOT_LIB are appended to the `loadpath` variable, but not saved with the
  `save` and `save set` commands. See 'help loadpath' for more details.

* Variable GDFONTPATH is the directory where png terminal searches TrueType
  fonts. You should set it to a directory where files like arial.ttf exist.
  Usually, it is
	SET GDFONTPATH=C:/WINDOWS/FONTS
  If you wish to set a default font for png, then set it like set via the
  environmental variable GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT; however, it is always
  better to use command "set terminal png font arial".

* Variable GNUPLOT_FONTPATH is used by the postscript driver as search path
 for TrueType fonts. Set it to
	SET GNUPLOT_FONTPATH=C:/WINDOWS/FONTS

* Variable GNUFITLOG holds the name of a file that saves fit results. The
  default it is fit.log. If the name ends with a "/" or "\", it is treated as a
  directory name, and "fit.log" will be created as a file in that directory.
